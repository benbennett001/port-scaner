# port-scanner
This project is a fun and interesting way to practice the  socket  library.

This simple project contain a simple menu with 4 options
1- read a file (list of ip) as was intended, but not necessarily, called devices.txt
2- scan open ports of a specific ip
3- scan open ports for a group of ips (devices.txt)
4- exit

I'll change the options eventually to make it more functional and efficient, feel free to use it and improve it.. good luck
